# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello everyone!

I'm a total newb here at github and love learning new things. I've been into audio engineering and production going on 15 years. Recently i've started working on wordpress, designing some simple ecommerce stores and taking on clients. I would like to take it further with writing my own CSS, HTML, Java Script. I'm mostly interested in UI/UX design for now. Looking to expand.
